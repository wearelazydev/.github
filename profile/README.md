## Description
wearelazydev is a cutting-edge platform where developers earn rewards through Pull Requests (PRs) and bug fixes. Powered by Celestia blockchain and zero-knowledge TLS (zkTLS), we ensure secure, private, and fair validation of contributions. Once a PR is merged, developers can manually claim their tokens without waiting for the owner to release funds.

## üõ† Problems wearelazydev Solves
### Manual Claiming by Owner Bounty
Traditional bounty platforms have Manual Claiming by Owner Bounty. wearelazydev automates this by allowing developers to have full access of the rewards.

### Lack of Transparency
Many platforms lack clear reward distribution tracking. wearelazydev leverages blockchain for full transparency and fairness.

### Delayed Claiming
Slow manual verifications cause delays in reward distribution. With zkTLS, wearelazydev ensures instant validation and payouts.

## üîÑ Flow
### **Owner Repository Flow**
1. **Buy $LAZY Token** - Fund bounties through token purchase.
2. **Create Issue & Bounty** - Assign rewards for GitHub issues.
3. **Merge the PR** - Owner reviews and merges contributions.
4. **Proof Submission** - GitHub API sends merge proof to zkTLS.
5. **Validation & Notification** - zkTLS verifies proof and notifies the smart contract.
6. **Bounty Distribution** - Smart contract processes payment.
7. **Developer Claims Reward** - Instant payout upon successful validation.

### **Developer Flow**
1. **Connect GitHub OAuth** - Grant API access.
2. **Submit a PR** - Solve an issue with code submission.
3. **PR Merged & Proof Sent** - GitHub API generates and sends proof to zkTLS.
4. **zkTLS Verification** - zkTLS validates proof.
5. **Claim Bounty Reward** - Smart contract processes the verified proof.
6. **Receive & Swap Tokens** - Developers can swap their $LAZY tokens.
